This project investigates predicting the alcohol content in white wine using regression techniques applied to a Wine Quality Dataset.  Several models were evaluated and compared through utilizing PyCaret.  After training and testing, the results showed that out of all the models, the CatBoost Regresser was the best performing model, accurately predicting alcohol content in white wine.  These results demonstrate how machine learning (ML) can be used to accurately predict alcohol levels, which can in turn aid in high production consistency and quality control in the wine industry.
